Internal Widilo build of the 5.5.0 MAUI wrapper with updated native SDKs. The C# API is unchanged: new native features are not exposed.

#### Changed
- Updated the native Android SDK to 5.8.1 (official `com.adjust.sdk:adjust-android:5.8.1` from Maven Central).
- Updated the native iOS SDK to 5.8.1 (official `AdjustSdk-iOS-tvOS-Dynamic-5.8.1.xcframework` release asset).
- Updated the Adjust Signature library to 5.8.0 on Android and iOS.

#### Fixed

### Version 5.5.0 (15th January 2026)

#### Added
- Added `GetAdidWithTimeout` method to the `Adjust` API to allow retrieving the ADID with a specified timeout. If the value is not obtained in time, `null` is returned via the callback.
- Added `GetAttributionWithTimeout` method to the `Adjust` API to allow retrieving the current attribution information with a specified timeout. If the value is not obtained in time, `null` is returned via the callback.
- Added ability to disable the reading of the app set ID on Android. You can do this by setting `IsAppSetIdReadingEnabled` property on your `AdjustConfig` instance to `false`.
- Added ability to disable SDK's interaction with `AppTrackingTransparency.framework` API. You can disable it by setting the `IsAppTrackingTransparencyUsageEnabled` property on your `AdjustConfig` instance to `false`.
- Added ability to initialize the SDK for the first session in delayed mode. You can start the SDK in the delayed mode by setting the `IsFirstSessionDelayEnabled` property on your `AdjustConfig` instance to `true`. To end the delay, make sure to call `EndFirstSessionDelay` method of `Adjust` instance. Additionally, you can use `EnableCoppaComplianceInDelay`, `DisableCoppaComplianceInDelay`, `SetExternalDeviceIdInDelay` methods, and on Android `EnablePlayStoreKidsComplianceInDelay` and `DisablePlayStoreKidsComplianceInDelay` methods.
- Added support for configuring store information via the `AdjustStoreInfo` object. You can now specify the store name and store app ID assigning `StoreInfo` property on your `AdjustConfig` instance. This enables the SDK to record the intended app store source during initialization.
- Added ability to send organic search referrer together with deep link. You can send it by setting the `Referrer` property of the `AdjustDeeplink` instance.
- Added `JsonResponse` field to `AdjustAttribution` where every key-value pair sent by the backend as part of the attribution response can be found.
- Added support for .NET 10 target frameworks for Android and iOS (conditional on the installed .NET SDK).
- Added Android plugin packages for Google License Verification (LVL), Meta Referrer, and OAID.

#### Changed
- Updated the Adjust Signature library version to 3.62.0.
